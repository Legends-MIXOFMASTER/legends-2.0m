Functional Scope (Online Course + Certification + Email Integration):

Create an online course system for “Namibian Bar Masters” with two course levels:

Basics Course

Pro Level Course

Each course should have:

Interactive modules (placeholder quizzes with radio/select inputs)

Progress tracking (session-based initially, later expandable with DB)

Completion button → triggers backend check

On completion:

Store user completion record in MongoDB (name, email, course level)

Send confirmation email using Nodemailer (use placeholder for SMTP)

If user completes both levels, auto-send a downloadable PDF certificate

Authentication:

Add login/register system (email/password)

Users must be logged in to access and complete courses

Email Verification:

Upon sign-up, send a verification email (simulate for now)

Only allow course access if email is verified

Certificate System:

Design a simple certificate template using HTML/CSS

Generate dynamic certificates with user name and course levels completed

Trigger PDF generation using a library like html-pdf or puppeteer

Email the certificate on completion of both levels

Design Scope (UI/UX Upgrade + Visual Overhaul):

Redesign entire site with this aesthetic direction:

A sleek, elegant design theme: black + rich gold + charcoal gray

Use serif + elegant modern fonts

Button hover animations: glowing gold or underline slides

Transitions and scroll effects like Framer-style templates

Gallery: animated carousel with smooth fade or slide effects

Homepage layout (Evive/SalesRocket inspired):

Hero banner with animated headline text

Floating "Enroll Now" CTA with hover bounce or shine effect

Animated stats or testimonials (fade-in/scroll-up)

Add light/dark theme toggle (optional)

Code + File Management:

Organize code with:

/public → index.html, styles, JS

/views → course pages and certificate view

/routes → auth, course, and certificate APIs

/models → user and progress schemas

Add environment config support:

.env → MONGO_URI, EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS

Set up server.js to include:

Express

MongoDB

Routes for: /api/auth, /api/courses, /api/certificates

Static routing for front-end pages
