Objective
Redesign the entire website interface to reflect a sleek, immersive experience inspired by Hawk by Framer. Use the company branding palette:

Primary: Deep Royal Navy Blue (#0a0f2c)

Secondary: Rich Burgundy Red (#4a1c2f)

Accent/Highlight: Rich Gold Metallic (#cba135)

Layout & Interaction Design Features to Implement:

Landing Page Layout (Homepage):

Full-screen hero section with large animated headline (scale/fade on load)

Scroll-triggered section reveals using smooth vertical transitions (like Hawk)

Add a dark overlay blur background behind text to highlight headings

Animated Navigation Bar:

Sticky nav bar with:

Left-aligned logo

Right-aligned menu links: About, Courses, Book Now, Gallery, Login

Dropdown menus with hover/fade-in animation

Mobile: collapsible hamburger menu with smooth slideout nav

Motion Design:

Page elements (headings, cards, buttons) should animate in using opacity + transform combos

Use friction-based transitions (ease-in-out, smooth deceleration)

Hero text: split text fade or slide reveal like in Hawk

Color Scheme and Backgrounds:

Background: deep navy with subtle burgundy gradients

Button/links: rich gold on hover glow effect

Font: Elegant serif for headings, modern sans-serif for body (Google Fonts: Playfair Display + Inter)

Buttons and Call-to-Action Elements:

Buttons with animated border or glow on hover (in gold)

Use layered hover effects (gold glow + upward movement)

CTA blocks should feel luxurious and cinematic

Gallery Section:

Masonry or grid layout with carousel slider

Modal Lightbox view on click

Images fade in on scroll

Optional: add gallery cycle auto-play with pause-on-hover

Courses Section:

Two large cards: Basic Course, Pro Course with animated icons

Add scroll-triggered progress bars or reveal-on-scroll lesson summaries

About Us Pages (for 3 Brands):

Header image with parallax scroll effect

Gold divider lines between sections

Bio/team blocks fade in with smooth motion

Footer:

Elegant multi-column layout

Social icons in gold

Contact info + newsletter signup form

Theme Consistency:

Use lots of space and contrast

Avoid harsh whites; use soft grays or semi-transparent overlays

Use gradients and shadows subtly, with high polish

Code Considerations:

Use HTML/CSS/JS (Vanilla or add GSAP/Framer Motion if needed)

Structure assets into public/, styles/, scripts/, and components/

Use CSS variables for color palette

Keep all transitions smooth and GPU-optimized

Add comments to explain major visual sections
